# Keith_On
A series of texts on topics I care about as an aid to my students, both present and past. I am trying to break them into course notes at the moment.  If you like this, let me know and send me feedback, suggestions, and revisions.

Currently I have set up:
# KOCO - Keith On... Computer Organization (ELC 3338)
# KOED - Keith On... Engineering Design (Egr 4390)
I will try to add more in the future.  I might also subdivide to make them match the courses better.
