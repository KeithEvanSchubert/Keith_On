Advanced Digital Design with the Verilog™ HDL
For an advanced course in digital design for seniors and first-year graduate students in electrical engineering,
computer engineering, and computer science.

This book builds on the student's background from a first course in logic design and focuses on developing,
verifying, and synthesizing designs of digital circuits. The Verilog language is introduced in an integrated, but
selective manner, only as needed to support design examples (includes appendices for additional language
details). It addresses the design of several important circuits used in computer systems, digital signal processing,
image processing, and other applications











The design of integrated digital systems encompassing both customized software and hardware.
Software/hardware design tradeoffs. Algorithm design for pipelining and parallelism. System latency and throughput tradeoffs. FPGA
optimization techniques. Integration with external systems and smart devices. Firmware configuration and embedded system
considerations.
