<H2>Abstract </H2>
<P>This article attempts to explain every aspect of the PS/2 mouse =
interface=20
including the physical and electrical interface, low-level protocol, =
modes of=20
operation, commands, and extensions. </P><A =
name=3DGeneral_Description></A>
<H2>General Description </H2>
<P>There are many types of pointing devices available for the modern PC=20
including mice, trackballs, touchpads, electronic whiteboards, etc. =
Virtually=20
all of these devices communicate on one of two interfaces: Universal =
Serial Bus=20
(USB) or the PS/2 mouse interface. Older pointing device interfaces =
include the=20
Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), RS-232 serial port, and the bus mouse =
interface. These=20
are obsolete and are not covered in this article. </P>
<P>The PS/2 mouse interface originally appeared in IBM's "Personal =
System/2"=20
computers in the late 80's and it remains a widely-supported interface. =
However,=20
USB has quickly caught on these last few years and will eventually =
replace the=20
PS/2 interface entirely. </P>
<P>The PS/2 mouse interface utilizes a bidirectional serial protocol to =
transmit=20
movement and button-state data to the computer's auxiliary device =
controller=20
(part of the keyboard controller). The controller, in turn, may send a =
number of=20
commands to the mouse to set the report rate, resolution, reset the =
mouse,=20
disable the mouse, etc. The host provides the mouse with a 5V ~100 mA =
power=20
supply. </P><A name=3DElectrical_Interface_.2F_Protocol></A>
<H2>Electrical Interface / Protocol </H2>
<P>The PS/2 mouse uses the same protocol as the PS/2 keyboard (a.k.a. AT =

keyboard). Click <A title=3D"PS/2 Mouse/Keyboard Protocol"=20
href=3D"http://www.computer-engineering.org/index.php?title=3DPS/2_Mouse/=
Keyboard_Protocol">here</A>=20
for detailed information on this protocol. </P><A=20
name=3DInputs.2C_Resolution.2C_and_Scaling></A>
<H2>Inputs, Resolution, and Scaling </H2>
<P>The standard PS/2 mouse interface supports the following inputs: X=20
(right/left) movement, Y (up/down) movement, left button, middle button, =
and=20
right button. The mouse periodically reads these inputs and updates =
various=20
counters and flags to reflect movement and button states. There are many =
PS/2=20
pointing devices that have additional inputs and may report data =
differently=20
than described in this document. One popular extension covered later in =
this=20
document is the Microsoft Intellimouse, which includes support for the =
standard=20
inputs as well as a scrolling wheel and two additional buttons. </P>
<P>The standard mouse has two counters that keep track of movement: the =
X=20
movement counter and the Y movement counter. These are 9-bit 2's =
complement=20
values and each has an associated overflow flag. Their contents, along =
with the=20
state of the three mouse buttons, are sent to the host in the form of a =
3-byte=20
movement data packet. The movement counters represent the mouse's offset =

relative to its position when the previous movement data packet was =
issued, or=20
when the last non-"Resend" (0xFE) command was successfully sent to the =
host.=20
</P>
<P>When the mouse reads its inputs it records the current state of its =
buttons=20
and increments/decrements the movement counters according to the amount =
of=20
movement that has occurred since the last input sample. If either of the =

counters has overflowed, the appropriate overflow flag is set. Futher=20
modification of the counter is disabled until it the counters are reset =
(due to=20
a packet being sent). </P>
<P>The parameter that determines the amount by which the movement =
counters are=20
incremented/decremented is the <I>resolution</I>. The default resolution =
is 4=20
counts/mm and the host may change that value using the "Set Resolution" =
(0xE8)=20
command. </P>
<P>There is a parameter that does not affect the movement counters, but =
does=20
affect the reported value of these counters. This parameter is =
<I>scaling</I>.=20
By default, the mouse uses 1:1 scaling, which has no effect on the =
reported=20
mouse movement. However, the host may select 2:1 scaling by issuing the =
"Set=20
Scaling 2:1" (0xE7) command. If 2:1 scaling is enabled, the mouse will =
apply the=20
following algorithm to the movement counters before sending their =
contents to=20
the host: </P>

<H2>Modes of Operation </H2>
<P>Data reporting is handled according to the mode in which the mouse is =

operating. There are four modes of operation: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Reset - The initial mode, in which the mouse performs =
initialization and=20
  self-diagnostics.=20
  <LI>Stream - The default operating mode, in which the mouse issues =
movement=20
  data packets when movement occurs or button state changes.=20
  <LI>Remote - The host must poll for movement data packets.=20
  <LI>Wrap - A purely diagnostic mode where the mouse echoes every =
received=20
  packet back to the host. </LI></UL><A name=3DReset_Mode></A>
<H3>Reset Mode </H3>
<P>The mouse enters reset mode at power-on or in response to the "Reset" =
(0xFF)=20
command. Upon entering this mode, the mouse performs a diagnostic =
self-test=20
called <I>BAT</I> (Basic Assurance Test) and sets the following default =
values:=20
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Sample Rate =3D 100 samples/sec=20
  <LI>Resolution =3D 4 counts/mm=20
  <LI>Scaling =3D 1:1=20
  <LI>Data Reporting =3D disabled </LI></UL>
<P>The mouse then sends a BAT completion code of either 0xAA (BAT =
successful) or=20
0xFC (Error). The host's response to a completion code other than 0xAA =
is=20
undefined. </P>
<P>Following the BAT completion code (0xAA or 0xFC), the mouse sends its =
device=20
ID of 0x00. This distinguishes it from a keyboard or nonstandard mouse. =
I have=20
read documents indicating the host should not transmit any data until it =

receives a device ID. However I've found some BIOS's will send the =
"Reset"=20
(0xFF) command immediately following the 0xAA received after a power-on =
reset.=20
</P>
<P>Once the mouse has sent its device ID to the host, it enters stream =
mode.=20
</P><A name=3DStream_Mode></A>
<H3>Stream Mode </H3>
<P>In stream mode the mouse sends movement data when it detects movement =
or a=20
change in state of one or more mouse buttons. The maximum rate at which =
this=20
data may be reported is known as the <I>sample rate</I>. This parameter =
ranges=20
from 10-200 samples/sec, with a default value of 100 samples/sec. The =
host may=20
set this value using the "Set Sample Rate" (0xF3) command. </P>
<P>Note that reporting is <B>disabled</B> by default. The mouse will not =

actually issue any movement data packets until it receives the "Enable =
Data=20
Reporting" (0xF4) command. </P>
<P>Stream mode is the default operating mode, and is otherwise set using =
the=20
"Set Stream Mode" (0xEA) command. </P><A name=3DRemote_Mode></A>
<H3>Remote Mode </H3>
<P>In remote mode the mouse reads its inputs and updates its =
counters/flags at=20
the current sample rate, but it does not automatically issue data =
packets when=20
movement has occured. Instead, the host polls the mouse using the "Read =
Data"=20
(0xEB) command. Upon receiving this command the mouse will issue a =
single=20
movement data packet and reset its movement counters. </P>
<P>The mouse enters remote mode upon receiving the "Set Remote Mode" =
(0xF0)=20
command. </P>
<P>Remote mode is rarely used. </P><A name=3DWrap_Mode></A>
<H3>Wrap Mode </H3>
<P>This is an "echoing" mode in which every byte received by the mouse =
is sent=20
back to the host. Even if the byte represents a valid command, the mouse =
will=20
not respond to that command--it will only echo that byte back to the =
host. There=20
are two exceptions to this: the "Reset" (0xFF) and "Reset Wrap Mode" =
(0xEC)=20
commands. The mouse treats these as valid commands and does not echo =
them back=20
to the host. </P>
<P>Wrap mode is rarely used. </P><A name=3DIntellimouse_Extensions></A>
<H2>Intellimouse Extensions </H2>
<P>A popular extension to the standard PS/2 mouse is the Microsoft =
Intellimouse.=20
This includes support for a total of five mouse buttons and three axes =
of=20
movement (right-left, up-down, and a scrolling wheel). These additional =
features=20
require the use of a 4-byte movement data packet rather than the =
standard 3-byte=20
packet. Since standard PS/2 mouse drivers cannot recognize this packet =
format,=20
the Intellimouse is required to operate exactly like a standard PS/2 =
mouse=20
unless it knows the drivers support the extended packet format. This =
way, if an=20
Intellimouse is used on a computer which only supports the standard PS/2 =
mouse,=20
it will still function except its scrolling wheel and 4th and 5th =
buttons will=20
be disabled. </P>
<P>After power-on or reset the Microsoft Intellimouse operates just like =
a=20
standard PS/2 mouse (ie, it uses a 3-byte movement data packet, responds =
to all=20
commands in the same way as a standard PS/2 mouse, and reports a device =
ID of=20
0x00.) To enable the scrolling wheel, the host sends the following =
command=20
sequence: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>Set sample rate 200=20
  <LI>Set sample rate 100=20
  <LI>Set sample rate 80 </LI></OL>
<P>The host then issues the "Get device ID" (0xF2) command and waits for =
a=20
response. If a standard PS/2 mouse (i.e., non-Intellimouse) is attached, =
it will=20
respond with a device ID of 0x00. In this case, the host will recognize =
the fact=20
that the mouse does have a scrolling wheel and will continue to treat it =
as a=20
standard PS/2 mouse. However, if a Microsoft Intellimouse is attached, =
it will=20
respond with an ID of 0x03. This tells the host that the attached =
pointing=20
device has a scrolling wheel, and the host will then expect the mouse to =
use the=20
following 4-byte movement data packet: </P>
